### Combination
Combinations are the way of selecting objects or numbers from a group of objects or collections, in such a way that the order of the objects does not matter.<br>
To calculate this we have to multiply the count of input character/word array with the required character length.<br>Eg: <code>4^3=64</code> calculates 3 character long combinations from a 4 character long input data set.


### Permutation
A permutation is an act of arranging objects or numbers in order.
